- 👋 Hi, I’m @saladshooter69
- 👀 I’m interested in all aspects of learning the programming of android products. I have bricked more phones than I can count trying to root or add on or WHATEVER im trying to do at the time. I am a welder,high school dropout (GED)and have absolutely no clue what I'm doing. That's what's driving me. I'm fascinated. It's a new language that I WANT to learn. I can't go to school,I'm poor and have to work,it is what it is. I don't know what to expect  or what I'm doing typing this because as far as computer literacy goes,I'm the least educated on this subject than anybody else on this site. I'm 46 and didn't touch my first computer til 08.ik,ik I didn't start USING one until last year. I now have a Chromebook and I'm fu@#_&g lost half the time,but I struggle on. Anyways,hello,this is me,😊
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how not to kill my phones and computer. Trying to find out why I have files on my phone that I can't download. They are mine,if I can't see em then why are they there. Go to play store to see if there's an app for that is a common occurrence,but never a solution because there's NEVER an app for that. It leaves me frustrated beyond belief. 🤔😫🤬🤬🧨
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing,I can't contribute to ANY conversation because as I stated before,I don't know shit about nothing!! But I'm willing to learn,fail,crash and burn....and get back up and try again.
- 📫 How to reach me dprit76@gmail.com or you can come to Las Vegas and I'll buy you a beer !!😊
